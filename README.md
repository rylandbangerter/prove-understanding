# prove-understanding
The Prove Understanding assignment in **Programming with Data Structures** was designed to test my grasp of data manipulation and algorithmic problem-solving using C#. The main task involved rotating a list, which required me to implement a method that would shift elements in the list by a specified number of positions. This not only reinforced my understanding of list operations but also helped me practice common algorithms like rotation and shifting.

To complete the assignment, I first worked with a `.docx` file, which I loaded into **Visual Studio Code**. This step introduced me to handling non-traditional data formats and working with external libraries to parse the file content. Once the file data was loaded, I applied the rotation algorithm to manipulate the list and output the result.

In addition to the technical aspects, this assignment also involved using **GitHub** for version control. I pushed updates to a repository to track my progress and share the project with instructors or teammates. Through this, I strengthened my ability to manage coding projects using Git, ensuring that I could work collaboratively and keep track of changes efficiently.

The project challenged me to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical problem and deepened my understanding of list operations and basic algorithms in C#. It also helped me build confidence in handling real-world data, working with external tools, and applying good programming practices.
